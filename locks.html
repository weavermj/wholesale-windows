    <h2>Saracen 6000 Multi-Point Door Lock</h2>
    <p>
        The lock has 3 hooks and 2 roller cams for enhanced performance and weather sealing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rollers ensure precise compression of the weather seal and door alignment in the frame,
        while the hooks offer extra security, keeping your home safe.
    </p>

    <p>The bi-directional hooks ensure maximum resistance to anti-lift and separation
        providing a secure barrier against forced entry.
    </p>

    <p>The central gearbox, available in two backsets, has a robust central hook with a snib facility on the
        reversible sash (latch) bolt. A split spindle option allows for back or front door operation on the
            same lock.
